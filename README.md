## Brume Overview

Brume provides a shared directoy service in which any file plaed in a shared directoy is automtically shared with specified Brume users. File sharing is directly between user devices without traversing a central server. The only central component is the Brume signaling server required to setup user-to-user connections.

Brume is distinguished from other peer-to-peer file sharing, such as File Pizza and WormHole.io in that Brume runs in the background keeping shared folders in-sync as the directory contents change; kind of like a dropbox without a server and across multiple user endpoints.
